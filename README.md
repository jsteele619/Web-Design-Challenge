# Web-Design-Challenge


For this challenge I created an html website with multiple landing pages.

You can find the html files in the html files folder. The images I used for the graphs are also in this folder, as well as the style.css page.

Here is my link to the Github hosted website: https://jsteele619.github.io/index.html
